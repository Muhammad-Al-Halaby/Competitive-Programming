# Senior Training (Level 4)

## Session 1 & 2

- Implicit Segment Tree.
- Persistent Segment Tree.
- Lazy propagation is a little different, we create new nodes when we push down the update.

- Persistent segment tree problems can be classified into two types:
1. Persistent segment tree containing some info for every prefix of an array, we use simple subtraction to answer range query.
1. Persistent segment tree containing some info for every path from the root to some value on a tree so we can use LCA and inclusion exclusion to calculate our queries.
