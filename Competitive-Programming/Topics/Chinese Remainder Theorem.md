# Chinese Remainder Theorem

Let p = p<sub>1</sub> * p<sub>2</sub> * ... * p<sub>k</sub>, where p<sub>i</sub> are pairwise relatively prime. In addition to p<sub>i</sub>, we are also given a set of congruence equations

x ≡ a<sub>1</sub> (mod p<sub>1</sub>)

x ≡ a<sub>2</sub> (mod p<sub>2</sub>)

.....

x ≡ a<sub>k</sub> (mod p<sub>k</sub>)

where a<sub>i</sub> are some given constants.

The original form of CRT then states that the given set of congruence equations always has one and exactly one solution modulo p.
