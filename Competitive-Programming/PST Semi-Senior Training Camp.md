<details>
<summary>Proof 1</summary>
a, b, a%b, ...... fa in general : anta equal aly 2blk b5tweten % aly 2blk
ax` + by` = g
r0 = a , r1 = b , ri = ri - 2 % ri - 1;
if(rk == 0) then r(k-1) is GCD
aXi + bYi = ri
aX0 + bY0 = r0 = a X0 = 1 , Y0 = 0 , X1 = 0 , Y1 =1
aX1 + bY1 = r1 = b

ri = r(i-2) mod r(i-1) = r(i-2) - qr(i-1) = r(i-2) - floor(ri-2 / ri-1) * ri-1
if we replace ri with :
aXi + bYi = [aX(i-2) + bY(i-2)] -floor(ri-2 - ri-1) * [aX(i-1) + bY(i-1)]
= a[X(i-2) - floor(r(i-2) / r(i-1)) * X(i-1)] + b [Y(i-2) - floor(r(i-2)/r(i-1)) * Y(i-1)]
Xi = X(i-2) - floor(r(i-2) / r(i-1)) * X(i-1)
Yi = Y(i-2) - floor(r(i-2) / r(i-1)) * Y(i-1)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Proof 2</summary>
gcd(a,b) = g means : g/a , g/b , no k>g that k /a , k/b
a = q2.g + 0 >> means remender = 0 , divisibale y3ny --------------------> 1
b = q1.g + 0 ~ ~ ~ --------------------> 2
gcd(a,b) = g hoa nfso gcd (b,a-b) hoa nfso gcd (b,c) hoa nfso gcd(b,a%b) ;

to prove : gcd (b,a-b)
from 1 & 2 > a - b = (q1 - q2)g + 0 that means divisibale by g , then g /(a-b)
k > g , k / b , k / a - b
b = q3.k + 0 -------------------->3
a-b = q4.k + 0 -------------------->4
from 3 & 4 a = (q3 + q4)k + 0
k/a contradiction

so gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,b-a)
= gcd (b, a-2b)
= gcd (b, a-3b)
= gcd (b, a-4b)
so gcd(a , b) = gcd(b,a%b)

a % b : if a > b then , a % b < (a/2)
if a < b then , a % b = a

hdek 3 integers a , b, c w arg3 kym x , y aly bt72a2 al mo3adla
aX + bY = c given that a , b , c integers
ax + by = mg : g = gcd (a , b)
